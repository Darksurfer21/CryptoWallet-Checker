# CryptoWallet-Checker

This script reads a list of mnemonic phrases, derives Ethereum addresses, and checks each for any balance. If a wallet with a balance is found, it displays the wallet type, address, mnemonic phrase, and balance. Users can choose to continue or stop the process after each wallet with a balance is found.

# Features

1. Wallet Identification: Detects the wallet type (Trust Wallet, MetaMask, or Other) based on standard Ethereum paths.

2. Balance Checking: Checks the balance of Ethereum addresses derived from provided mnemonic phrases.

3. User-Controlled Processing: Allows users to stop or continue checking after each wallet with a balance is found.

5. Concurrency: Uses threading for faster processing, making it suitable for handling large mnemonic files.

6. Detailed Reporting: Provides a summary of all checked phrases, including the number of wallets found with a balance.

# How It Works

Load Mnemonics: The script reads a list of mnemonic phrases from mnemonics.txt, with one phrase per line.
Generate Addresses: It derives Ethereum addresses for each mnemonic using a standard derivation path (m/44'/60'/0'/0/0).
Check Balance: For each derived address, it checks the balance on the Ethereum mainnet.
Display Results: If a balance is found, the script displays the wallet type, address, mnemonic, and balance in ETH, and prompts the user to continue or stop.
Save Results: Wallets with a balance are saved to found_wallets.txt for future reference.
Prerequisites
Python: Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed.
Infura API: Obtain a Project ID from Infura to access the Ethereum mainnet.
Dependencies: Install required packages using:
bash
Copy code
pip install web3 bip44
Usage
Set Up:

Replace YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID in the script with your actual Infura Project ID.
Place mnemonics.txt in the same directory, containing one mnemonic phrase per line.
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python mnemonic_checker.py
Interact:

The script will begin checking balances and display results in the console.
After finding a wallet with balance, it will ask if you want to continue. Type Y to proceed or N to stop.
The checking process will stop if you input 'N' or type 'stop' in the console.
View Results:

All wallets with a balance are saved in found_wallets.txt, showing wallet type, address, mnemonic, and balance in ETH.
Important Notes
Concurrency: The script uses threading to handle multiple mnemonics simultaneously, improving speed.
Eth Balance Display: Balances are shown in Ether (ETH).
File Safety: found_wallets.txt is updated with each wallet found with balance, so ensure no sensitive information is left in the file if sharing it.
Example
plaintext
Copy code
Found wallet with balance!
Wallet Type: Trust Wallet / MetaMask
Address: 0x123456789ABCDEF...
Mnemonic: example mnemonic phrase
Balance: 0.15 ETH

Edit the code and remove the bip44 because I cannot install it on my replit and make a interface for the mnemonic checker which I can see on the replit webview

To remove the bip44 dependency, we’ll use the mnemonic library to generate Ethereum addresses directly, avoiding the need for an external wallet library. We’ll also add a simple web interface using Flask, allowing you to view the process on Replit’s webview.

Here’s the updated script:

It generates Ethereum addresses from mnemonic phrases without using bip44.
It uses Flask to provide a web interface, allowing you to monitor the checking process.
Installation of Required Packages
Before running, install the following packages:

pip install web3 mnemonic flask

Explanation of the Updated Code
Ethereum Address Generation: We use the mnemonic library to convert mnemonics into an Ethereum-compatible address by hashing the seed.

# Web Interface:

/ Route: Displays a form where you can paste mnemonics and start the checking process.

/start Route: Processes the mnemonics and starts the checking in a background thread.

/stop Route: Allows stopping the processing manually.

Automatic Refresh: The web page refreshes every 5 seconds, so you can see the results live.

Concurrency: The background thread keeps the main web server responsive, allowing real-time updates while processing mnemonics.

Usage Instructions
Run the Script: Run this script on Replit, and it will open a web server that you can access via the webview.

Add Mnemonics: Paste your mnemonics (one per line) in the text area on the web page and click "Start Checking."

View Results: Found wallets with balance are displayed on the page with the address, mnemonic phrase, and balance.

Stop Checking: You can click a button to stop checking mid-process if needed.

Output: All results appear in the “Checking Results” section, which refreshes every few seconds.

# Important Note
Replace YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID with your actual Infura Project ID to connect to the Ethereum mainnet.
